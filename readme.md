backbone.routemanager v0.2.0-wip
================================

Created by Tim Branyen [@tbranyen](http://twitter.com/tbranyen)

Provides missing features to the Backbone.Router.

Depends on Underscore, Backbone and jQuery.  You can swap out the jQuery
dependency completely with a custom configuration.

## Usage ##

### Defining a RouteManager ###

A route manager is your **App Router**, you will be able to define any number
of **Nested Routers**.

*Assuming you have an app namespace*

``` javascript
// A basic route manager, works just like a Backbone.Router (cause it is one)
var AppRouter = Backbone.RouteManager.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index"
  },

  index: function() {
    window.alert("Navigated successfully");
  }
});

// Create a new instance of the app router
app.router = new AppRouter();

// Trigger the index route
app.router.navigate("", true);
```

#### Alternative method of defining a RouteManager ####

If you don't wish to extend `Backbone.RouteManager`, you can simply make a new
instance of the constructor and assign that to save a step.

``` javascript
// A basic route manager, works just like a Backbone.Router (cause it is one)
app.router = new Backbone.RouteManager({
  routes: {
    "": "index"
  },

  index: function() {
    window.alert("Navigated successfully");
  }
});

// Trigger the index route
app.router.navigate("", true);
```

### Named params object ###

All route callbacks get access to a special object on the Router called
`params` which maps directly to the variables and splats defined in the route.

``` javascript
// A basic route manager, works just like a Backbone.Router (cause it is one)
var AppRouter = new Backbone.RouteManager({
  routes: {
    ":id/*path": "index"
  },

  index: function(id, path) {
    // You can use the arbitrarily named args you define... or you can use the
    // params object on the router.
    window.alert(id == this.params.id);
    window.alert(path == this.params.path);
  }
});

// Create a new instance of the app router
app.router = new AppRouter();

// Trigger the index route
app.router.navigate("5/hi", true);
```

This is useful for a number of reasons including a special significance for
`before/after` filters that are defined later on.

### Nested Routers ###

So far we haven't seen anything special that we couldn't do already with a
normal `Backbone.Router`.  One of the major benefits of RouteManager is that
you can define nested Routers.  These are defined in the same way as normal
routes, except you pass a `Backbone.Router` class instead.

Nested Routers are just normal `Backbone.Router`'s.

For example:

``` javascript
var SubRouter = Backbone.Router.extend({
  routes: {
    "": "index",
    "test": "test"
  },

  index: function() {
    window.alert("SubRouter navigated successfully");
  },

  test: function() {
    window.alert("sub/test triggered correctly");
  }
});

var AppRouter = Backbone.RouteManager.extend({
  routes: {
    // Define a root level route
    "": "index",

    // Define a sub route
    "sub/": SubRouter
  },

  index: function() {
    window.alert("MasterRouter navigated successfully");
  }
});

// Create a new instance of the app router
app.router = new AppRouter();

// Trigger the test route under sub
app.router.navigate("sub/test", true);
```

## Configuration ##

Overriding RouteManager options has been designed to work just like
`Backbone.sync`.  You can override at a global level using
`RouteManager.configure` or you can specify when instantiating a `RouteManager`
instance.

### Global level ###

Lets say you wanted to use underscore.deferred for the Promise lib instead of
jQuery.

``` javascript
// Override all RouteManagers to use underscore.deferred
Backbone.RouteManager.configure({
  deferred: function() {
    return new _.Deferred();
  },

  when: function(promises) {
    return _.when.apply(null, promises);
  }
});
```

### Instance level ###

In this specific router, use underscore.deferred for the Promise lib instead of
jQuery.

``` javascript
app.router = new Backbone.RouteManager({
  routes: {
    "": "index"
  },

  options: {
    deferred: function() {
      return new _.Deferred();
    },

    when: function(promises) {
      return _.when.apply(null, promises);
    }
  }
});
```

### Defaults ###

* __Deferred__:
Uses jQuery deferreds for internal operation, this may be overridden to use
a different Promises/A compliant deferred.

``` javascript
deferred: function() {
  return $.Deferred();
}
```

* __When__:
This function will trigger callbacks based on the success/failure of one or
more deferred objects.

``` javascript
when: function(promises) {
  return $.when.apply(null, promises);
}
```
